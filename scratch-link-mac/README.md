# Notes for Scratch Link 2.0 on macOS

## Requirements

* Scratch Link 2.0 itself targets macOS 10.13 and above
* The Safari extension requires macOS 10.15+ and Safari 14+
* The Safari extension is only fully supported when Scratch Link 2.0 is installed through the Mac App Store
  * Even if the extension is signed for Developer ID distribution, Safari will treat it as "unsigned" if it didn't
    come from the Mac App Store.
  * You can use the extension anyway by checking "Allow Unsigned Extensions" in Safari's developer menu.
  * In non-MAS builds of Scratch Link 2.0, the menu item to manage the extension will appear if you hold Option.
