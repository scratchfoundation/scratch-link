# The variable SCRIPT_INPUT_FILE_0 should be the path to the manifest.json in the source tree
# The variable SCRIPT_OUTPUT_FILE_0 should be the path to which this script should write the modified manifest.json

# jq doesn't edit a file in-place, which could be a problem if both paths are the same
# modify it in two steps to cover that possibility (and it still works if they're different)

# first, read the manifest file and store the modified contents in a variable
NEW_MANIFEST_CONTENTS="$(jq ".version = \"${MARKETING_VERSION}\"" "${SCRIPT_INPUT_FILE_0}")"
echo "Injected version=${MARKETING_VERSION} into ${SCRIPT_INPUT_FILE_0}"

# second, write the new contents to the manifest file
echo -E "${NEW_MANIFEST_CONTENTS}" > "${SCRIPT_OUTPUT_FILE_0}"
echo "Result saved as ${SCRIPT_OUTPUT_FILE_0}"
